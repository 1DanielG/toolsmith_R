## Steph Locke's HIBPwned

Utilise Troy Hunt's HaveIBeenPwned.com API to check if your email addresses and/or user names have been present in a publicly disclosed data breach or paste.

## HIBPwned?

```{r}
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
# Get or upgrade from github
devtools::install_github("censornet/HIBPwned")
library("HIBPwned")
account_breaches(c("rmcree@yahoo.com", "holisticinfosec@gmail.com", "russ@holisticinfosec.org"), truncate = TRUE)
```
## HIBPasted?

Determine what information may have been pasted (Pastebin, etc.)

```{r}
library("HIBPwned")
pastes(c("rmcree@yahoo.com", "holisticinfosec@gmail.com", "russ@holisticinfosec.org"))
```
